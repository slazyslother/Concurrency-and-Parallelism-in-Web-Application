# Concurrency and Parallelism in Web Application

This project involves implementing concurrency control in a web application to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Concurrency primitives such as threading, async/await, or other mechanisms will be utilized to achieve parallelism while ensuring data integrity and avoiding race conditions.

<br/>

## Features

- __Concurrency Control__: Utilize threading, async/await, or other concurrency primitives to handle multiple tasks concurrently.
- __Parallelism__: Enable simultaneous execution of tasks to improve application performance.
- __Data Integrity__: Implement strategies to ensure data integrity and avoid race conditions when accessing shared resources.
- __Scalability__: Design the application to scale efficiently with increasing workload by leveraging concurrency and parallelism.
- __Error Handling__: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and ensure application stability.

## Utility Functions

- __Thread Management__: Manage thread creation, execution, and synchronization.
- __Async/Await Patterns__: Implement asynchronous programming patterns to improve responsiveness and scalability.
- __Resource Locking__: Utilize locks, mutexes, or other synchronization primitives to protect shared resources from concurrent access.
- __Task Scheduling__: Optimize task scheduling to maximize resource utilization and minimize latency.

<br/>

## Implementation

- __Threading__: Use native threading capabilities provided by the programming language or framework to execute tasks concurrently.
- __Async/Await__: Implement asynchronous methods and utilize async/await keywords to execute I/O-bound tasks asynchronously without blocking the main thread.
- __Concurrency Primitives__: Explore other concurrency primitives such as semaphores, barriers, or channels depending on the specific requirements of the application.
- __Testing__: Perform thorough testing to verify the correctness and performance of the concurrency implementation under various scenarios and workloads.

## Popular Operations

- __Handling Concurrent HTTP Requests__: Implement asynchronous request handling to process multiple HTTP requests concurrently without blocking the server thread pool.
- __Database Operations__: Use async/await to execute database queries asynchronously, allowing other tasks to continue execution while waiting for the database response.
- __File I/O__: Utilize threading or async/await to perform file I/O operations concurrently, improving throughput and responsiveness.
- __Task Parallelism__: Divide complex tasks into smaller units and execute them in parallel using threading or other parallel programming constructs.
- __Resource Access__: Implement proper synchronization mechanisms to prevent data corruption when multiple threads access shared resources such as database connections or in-memory caches.

## Testing

- __Integration Testing__
  - **Manual Testing:** Perform end-to-end testing by sending requests to the API endpoints and verifying the overall functionality, including concurrency control, error handling, and data integrity.
  - **Automated Testing:** Write automated integration tests that cover various scenarios, including concurrent requests handling, error scenarios, and data integrity checks. Use tools like Postman, Newman, or API testing libraries for automated integration testing.


1. __Concurrent HTTP Requests Handling__
   - **Manual Testing:** Send multiple concurrent HTTP requests to the /api/requests endpoint using tools like cURL or Postman. Observe if the server handles the requests concurrently and responds without blocking.
   - **Automated Testing:** Write automated tests using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha. Simulate concurrent requests using libraries like Axios or SuperTest and assert that the server handles them properly.
2. __Error Handling__
   - **Manual Testing:** Send requests to the /api/requests endpoint with invalid input parameters or simulate unexpected server errors. Verify that the server responds with the appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) and error messages.
   - **Automated Testing:** Write automated tests to cover different error scenarios by sending requests with invalid parameters or triggering server errors. Assert that the server responds with the expected status codes and error messages.
3. __Data Integrity and Avoiding Race Conditions__
   - **Manual Testing:** Create test cases where multiple concurrent requests access and modify shared resources (e.g., database records). Verify that the data remains consistent and no race conditions occur.
   - **Automated Testing:** Write automated tests to simulate concurrent access to shared resources and verify data integrity. Use testing frameworks that support concurrency testing and assertions for thread safety.

## Example Scenarios

- __Search for Products by Name__: A user wants to find products that include the term "xyz" in their name.
- __Filter Products by Price Range__: A user wants to view products priced between $a and $b.
- __Filter Products by Category__: A user wants to see all products in the "xyz" category.
- __Filter Products by Availability__: A user wants to see all products that are currently in stock.
- __Combined Filter__: A user wants to see all "xyz" products priced between $a and $b that are currently in stock.
